The application loads audio files containing object-based meta-data and provides head-tracked dynamic binaural rendering of the content to create an immersive 3D audio experience for headphone listeners. The user can interact with the rendering by muting individual audio objects and switching between the binaural rendering mode and conventional stereo rendering. This application demonstrates the future of broadcast sound experiences over the web, where immersive content is rendered on the client and can be adapted to listener context, as page layout is adapted to device context today with responsive design.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary
Virtual reality (VR) has received an enormous amount of publicity over the past few years. Along with this publicity has arisen a great deal of conflicting terminology, some unrealistic expectations, and a great deal of uninformed commentary. This chapter discusses that VR is an interactive, participatory environment that could sustain many remote users sharing a virtual place. VR is characterized by the illusion of participation in a synthetic environment than external observation of such an environment. It relies on three-dimensional, stereoscopic, head-tracked displays, hand/body tracking, and binaural sound. VR is an immersive, multisensory experience. It is also referred to as virtual environments, virtual worlds, or microworlds. It has the potential to provide additional power to its users through increased perceptual fidelity. It can also improve the performance of users by lowering the cognitive load in the completion of a task. VR can improve the quality of life for workers in hazardous or uncomfortable environments and may eventually have impact on the whole society.}

abstract = {Within last years, movement sonification turned out to be an appropriate support for motor perception and motor control that can display physical motion in a very rich and direct way. But how should movement sonification be configured to support motor learning? The appropriate selection of movement parameters and their transformation into characteristic motion features is essential for an auditory display to become effective. In this paper, we introduce a real-time sonification framework for all common MIDI environments based on acceleration and orientation data from inertial sensors. Fundamental processing steps to transform motion information into meaningful sound will be discussed. The proposed framework of inertial motion capturing, kinematic parameter selection and possible kinematic acoustic mapping provides a basis for mobile real-time movement sonification which is a prospective powerful training tool for rehabilitation and sports and offers a broad variety of application possibilities.}

Sonification conveys information by using non-speech sounds. To listen to data as sound and noise can be a surprising new experience with diverse applications ranging from novel interfaces for visually impaired people to data analysis problems in many scientific fields.
This book gives a solid introduction to the field of auditory display, the techniques for sonification, suitable technologies for developing sonification algorithms, and the most promising application areas. The book is accompanied by an online repository of sound examples.},
